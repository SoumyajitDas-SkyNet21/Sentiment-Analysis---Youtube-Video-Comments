# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction

- The YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis project is designed to analyze the sentiments expressed in comments on a specific YouTube video. The goal is to classify comments into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. This analysis provides insights into the overall audience reaction, helping creators, marketers, and researchers better understand public opinion.

## Purpose of the Project

- **Audience Insights**: Understand how viewers respond emotionally to content.

- **Feedback Analysis**: Extract meaningful feedback for content improvement.

- **Community Moderation**: Identify and address harmful or overly negative comments.

- **Marketing Insights**: Assess sentiment trends for campaigns or videos.

## Key Features

- Fetching and processing comments using the YouTube API.

- Filtering and cleaning non-English, empty, or emoji-only comments.

- Sentiment analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner).

- Visualization of sentiment distribution using bar and pie charts.

- Storage of analyzed data for further use.

## Workflow

- ### Step 1: Generating API Key

    - Obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console for the YouTube Data API.

    - Use the API key securely to fetch video data and comments.
 
- ### Step 2: Importing Dependencies

  The following Python libraries are used:

    - emoji: To detect emoji-only comments.

    - vaderSentiment: For sentiment analysis.

    - google-api-python-client: To interact with the YouTube API.

    - langdetect: To filter English comments.

    - matplotlib: For visualizing sentiment distribution.

    - pandas: To structure and manage comment data.
 
- ### Step 3: Fetching Comments

    - Extract the video ID and channel ID using the YouTube Data API.

    - Fetch the top-level comments from the specified video.
 
- ### Step 4: Filtering Comments

    - Remove comments containing only emojis or whitespace.

    - Apply a threshold to consider comments where text characters constitute at least 65% of the total characters.

- ### Step 5: Extracting English Comments

    - Use the langdetect library to filter comments written in English, ensuring consistent analysis.

- ### Step 6: Sentiment Analysis

    - Apply VADER to classify each comment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on compound polarity scores:

            - Compound score ‚â• 0.05: Positive.

            - Compound score ‚â§ -0.05: Negative.

            - Otherwise: Neutral.

- ### Step 7: Sentiment Distribution

    - Count the number of comments in each sentiment category:

        - Positive: Viewer appreciation or satisfaction.

        - Negative: Criticism or dissatisfaction.

        - Neutral: Neutral or ambiguous responses.

- ### Step 8: Visualizing Comments

    - Bar Chart: Displays the count of comments in each sentiment category.

    - Pie Chart: Shows the percentage distribution of sentiments.

- ### Step 9: Storing Results

    - Save analyzed comments and their sentiments into a text file for record-keeping and further analysis.

#### Importing necessary dependencies 


```python
# For Fetching Comments
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
# For filtering comments 
import re
# For filtering comments with just emojis
import emoji
# Analyze the sentiments of the comment
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
# For Visualization 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
```

#### Fetching the video id & channel id 


```python
# Storing the api in API_KEY variable
API_KEY='AIzaSyAKylkn9ANwkb2gA1q8MEVpMrs_a_UbHJY'

# Initializing Youtube API 
youtube=build('youtube','v3',developerKey=API_KEY)

video_id=input("Enter Youtube Video URL : ")[-11:]
print("Video Id: "+ video_id)

# Getting the channelId of the video uploader 
video_response=youtube.videos().list(
                part='snippet',
                id=video_id).execute()

# Splitting the response for channelId
video_snippet=video_response['items'][0]['snippet']
uploader_channel_id=video_snippet['channelId']
print("Channel Id: "+uploader_channel_id)


               


```

    Enter Youtube Video URL :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSeaHfkd3M8
    

    Video Id: pSeaHfkd3M8
    Channel Id: UCDPM_n1atn2ijUwHd0NNRQw
    

#### Fetching Comments 


```python
# Fetch comments 
print("Fetching Comments...")
comments=[]
nextPageToken=None
while len(comments) <600:
    request=youtube.commentThreads().list(
        part='snippet',
        videoId=video_id,
        maxResults=100,
        pageToken=nextPageToken )

    response=request.execute()
    for item in response['items']:
        comment=item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']
        # Check if the comment is not from video uploader 
        if comment['authorChannelId']['value']!=uploader_channel_id:
            comments.append(comment['textDisplay'])
        nextPageToken=response.get('nextPageToken')

        if not nextPageToken:
            break
    # Printing 5 comments

### Challenges Faced

- Filtering non-English comments accurately.

- Handling edge cases like mixed-language comments or incomplete sentences.

- Managing API rate limits while fetching large volumes of comments.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of data science techniques to extract valuable insights from unstructured data like YouTube comments. By automating the process of sentiment analysis, this tool can help creators and analysts improve content strategies, enhance audience engagement, and maintain a positive online community.

### Future Enhancements

- Incorporate advanced NLP techniques like BERT for more nuanced sentiment analysis.

- Extend the analysis to replies in comment threads.

- Support for multiple languages to capture a global audience.

- Build a dashboard for real-time sentiment tracking.
